Have you ever felt the Government in your countries doing a questionable thing? how every politician that did wrong never put in their place and got off scot-free, how they and their political party did whatever they pleased to fulfill their personal gains.

In Akumetsu, the plot is revolving around that theme how a fine, well running country like Japan have a troubling issue as well, and by the people in power that accepted as normal, and they see that majority of the citizen can't do anything about it.

In the first chapter we served with Politician, Alcohol and Illegal Prostitution, you know, normal stuff, but with ever growing debt the nation amass, with the big salary they got,these people just can't navigate the countries to a better place, they don't know how to take responsibilities just because they were a respected figure, none of the lower class citizen could doubt their action.

In another chapter we got this politician that his passion for building a toll road is unmatched to the point he done whatever it takes to build one, even submit to shoddy path that makes the nation finance took another hit. but because they were seen as respectable class of a citizen no citizen could asks their action
